# RandomSelector
This simple python app is used to help smooth out the standup meetings by randomly selecting a person to go next and keep track of who has went. The program uses PyQt5 and a text file. The source of the names is a simple text file named "roster.txt." It is important to note that the first name in the text file roster will be the scrum master and the second will be the Product owner. 

Known bug: When draging & dropping an item if you see two lines around an item in the destination ListView, the item that you just dropped will be deleted. Just move your item so that you see one line in between two items or drop in the white space of the destination ListView
